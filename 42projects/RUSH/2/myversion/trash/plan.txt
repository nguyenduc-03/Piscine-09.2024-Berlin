		Take number as argument and convert to letter value

Take up 2 arguments :
	1 = it is the value need to convert
	2 = first is new reference dict and second is value need to convert


Error\n :
	when the argument is a negative number

Notice :
	Will complied with make ( need Makefile)
	take value up to unsigned long
	executable name : rush-02
	Program will use word in the given dict ( this can be modified but 
the inital keys cant be removed). Program will prefer the given dict than the
later add. The order doesnt play a role. Oke for empty lines. 
Print "Dict Error\n" if error from dict or it doesnt found a answer.

	Carefull with malloc, dont forget to free
	
	
Function needed :
	ft_atoi
	Makefile to run ( include clean also)
	ft_check_dict 
	ft_split_int ( make number to smaller part to be found in dict, return
array of string from biggest to smallest, malloc)
	ft_print_result(take array of string and search in dict and print it)
	ft_how_long_dict()
