		Take number as argument and convert to letter value

Take up 2 arguments :
	1 = it is the value need to convert
	2 = first is new reference dict and second is value need to convert


Error\n :
	when the argument is a negative number

Notice :
	Will complied with make ( need Makefile)
	take value up to unsigned long
	executable name : rush-02
	Program will use word in the given dict ( this can be modified but 
the inital keys cant be removed). Program will prefer the given dict than the
later add. The order doesnt play a role. Oke for empty lines. 
Print "Dict Error\n" if error from dict or it doesnt found a answer.

	Carefull with malloc, dont forget to free
	
	
Function needed :
4.	ft_atoi D
7.	Makefile to run ( include clean also)D
	ft_check_dict 
	ft_how_long_dict()D

3.	ft_string_to_int_of_array() M
2.	ft_is_valid() just number no space return strlen DDA
5.	char *ft_compare(int *nb) with dict M
6.	char *ft_print_it(char a) after compare M
	main.c : D
